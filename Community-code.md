This page has been done to group code we saw everywhere. It contains some complete projects or sometimes only sample code made by the community but all can can be interesting to study.

Please keep in mind that some of them are not maintained, it can have a gap with the latest version of PVsneslib and do not build correctly.

Feel free to contribute and add a link to your project !

### Sound test project :

[This code](https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib/files/6565523/SoundTest_ByDiegoLeao_PvsneslibV3.zip) made by diegoleao with PVSneslib v3 will explain you how to manage the audio part with the library (don't forget to read the "Readme" file for essential information that is not present in the code itself). 
If you need the previous version of SoundTest (for PVSneslib v2) you can find it [here](https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib/files/5396843/SoundTest_ByDiegoLeao.zip).
