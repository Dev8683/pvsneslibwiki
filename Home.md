![PVSnesLib](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48180545/170839910-0455245c-6af4-495a-8165-24d28592dd85.jpeg)

PVSnesLib is an open and free library to develop programs for the Nintendo SNES using the C programming language.

Created initially for the 20th birthday of the Nintendo SNES, it has been evolved a lot and is now mainly coded in assembler for performances reasons. It is also directly usable in asm for those who do not want to use C language but without rewriting everything from scratch.

PVSneslib content is split in 3 parts
* The library itself and a Doxygen documentation (in the docs folder).
* The tools and compiler (compatible on Windows and Linux operating systems but for **32 bits only**)
* The examples (sprites, sound, graphics, debug, ...)

You can download the complete archive in [release section](https://github.com/alekmaul/pvsneslib/releases) then check the Wiki sections to get installation instructions and basics tutorials.

Welcome to PVSnesLib world and enjoy doing some homebrews for your SNES !
