These basic tutorials aim to give you the basis to start developing on the Super NES using PVSneslib.

Written in C language (ASM is also possible and recommended for critical tasks), you'll be able to fully understand them if you already have basic knowledge on how the SNES works.

So, before you start reading the tutorials, be sure to check and read these others documents:

  * [Complete SNES specs](http://problemkaputt.de/fullsnes.htm) by Martin Korth
